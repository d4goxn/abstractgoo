	"content": "TMePlz is a fictional tshirt company. I got to do a really cool retro / psychadelic isometric design, as a Wordpress theme. The focus of the project, aside from graphic design, was the S2 Member plugin for handling user logins. I don't think we used any functionality that wasn't already available in the WP API. Of all the sites I have designed, this one is definitely my favorite graphic design. I hope I get to use it for a real project.<img src=\"images/posts/tmeplz/login.png\" alt=\"tmeplz login screen\" class=\"right\" />"
