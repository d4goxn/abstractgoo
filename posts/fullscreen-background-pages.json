	"content": "I've always liked fullscreen background pages, but there is one problem: Load speed. A nice high res photo could weigh in at a couple MB, which will really slow down a page load. The problem isn't usually on the users end however, most of us have 10Mb internet connections at home. Those of us with smartphones normally only browse on mobile while connected to WiFi, because 4G packets crawl like drunk babies and cost more than their weight in gold.\n\nThe bottleneck is really at the server's end of the pipe. Cheap web hosts don't usually have good upload bandwidth, and CDNs are expensive, unless your site is actually making good coin. The solution? Hotlinking. [Imgur](http://imgur.com) lets us do it free and simple, and from now on, I will be taking full advantage. Damn those guys kick ass!"
